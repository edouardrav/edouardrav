## Hi! I'm Edouard 🍉

I'm a **fullstack web developer** in love with **Vue.js** and **Ruby on Rails** ⌨️ (by the way I play **jazz** too 🎹)

Recently I've worked on:
- *cogito*, on online training web app to develop critical thinking skills
- *musicadmin*, a rails app to help professional musicians keep track of all their gigs information and admin documents 🎵
- *genearbre*, a rails family tree web app 🌳
- some exciting *three.js* projects 🔸
